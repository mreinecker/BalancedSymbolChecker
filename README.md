## Description:
This program checks a string for balanced (opening and closing) symbols, 
checking for "(), [], {}, /* */" in any particular order. The user should be able to type in
any combination of these symbols and the program will return a result if the symbols are balanced,
how many pairs of each type of symbol were found, and what symbols were found with no pairs.
